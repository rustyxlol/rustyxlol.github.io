Hello there. I am **Rusty**, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate currently residing in India.  

I am an amateur programmer and have been working with **Python** for about a year now.  
I do like the high level aspect of Python but I've been leaning towards **Rust** these days
because it makes you _think._  
I have also worked with **C**, **C#** and **JavaScript**.

I have been with computers since I was a kid and have been profoundly in love with
mathematics ever since I found a teacher who would guide me through maths and life, 
which also ignited a passion for teaching.

I love going on adventures with topics that I find intriguing. Particularly topics that
have to do with mathematics and programming, such as Data Analytics/Machine Learning and the like.  

When I'm not doing development work or learning, I find it very relaxing to do cargo deliveries across 
Europe in Euro Truck Simulator 2 while listening to Joe Rogan's Podcast called
[The Joe Rogan Experience](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk)
