I am writing this in Vim emulated VSCode because using Vim straight from the terminal
might make me dislike it and never look at it again, ThePrimeagen also recommended
emulating it in VSCode and so did the Learn Vim extension on VSCode marketplace.

The hardest part for me right now is the navigation, hjkl don't make a lot of sense and
my fingers try to go towards the arrow keys and I have to fight the urge to use
arrow keys ðŸ—¿.

Regardless, everything I do from today onwards shall be in VSCode emulated Vim.  
For some reason, my shortcuts do not work(like opening markdown preview using ctrl k v),
but I guess I'll have to live with that since I don't think that will be in Vim.  

I would also like to mention that by one week I mean 168 development hours in VSCode,
which includes writing this blog post. Because I could sleep for a week and tell the world
that I used Vim for a week and regretted it. I won't measure the time but hopefully my 
git history will be the evidence of what I did.
