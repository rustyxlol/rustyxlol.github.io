## Problem statement
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Note:** 
* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3. 

**Example 1**
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011  
has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000  
has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101  
has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

## Solutions
### Approach 1: Hotshot
Using the [`count_ones`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html#method.count_ones) built-in in Rust.

**Implementation in Rust**
```rs
fn hamming_weight(n: u32) -> i32 {
    n.count_ones() as i32
}
```

Time Complexity: $O(n)$  
Runtime on LeetCode: $0$ms

### Approach 2: Modulo and Division
The normal way is to check every ending digit and if it is a one, we add it to our count.  
Dividing the number by 10 gets rid of the last digit, and you can use shift operator in this case
`num >> 1`  

**Pseudocode**
```text
while num > 0
    count += num % 2
    num /= 10
```

**Implementation in Rust**
```rs
fn hamming_weight(mut n: u32) -> i32 {
    let mut count = 0;
    while n > 0 {
        count += n % 2;
        n = n >> 1;
    }
    count as i32
}
```

Time Complexity: $O(n)$  
Runtime on LeetCode: $0$ms   


### Approach 3: Bit Manipulation
Quite a clever approach where you utilize `number` and `number - 1`.  
Basically, anding those two together will yield you a number or a zero.  

Consider the following example: `1011`   

Subtracting it with previous number we get `1010`  
Anding those two together we get `1010`, add 1 to our count.  

Now and `1010` with `1001`, which is `1000`, add 1 to our count.  

Now `1000` and `0111`, which is `0000`, add 1 to our count.  

The number is now 0 so stop the loop.  

**Implementation in Rust**
```rs
fn hamming_weight(mut n: u32) -> i32 {
    let mut count = 0;
    while n > 0 {
        n = n & (n-1);
        count += 1;
    }
    count
}
```
