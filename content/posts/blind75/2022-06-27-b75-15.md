## Problem statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  

**Example 1**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Solutions

### Approach 1: Fibonacci Series

Randomly found this approach while I was drawing out different ways for
4, 5 and 6.  

Apparently, it's a Fibonacci sequence because:  
For `n = 2`, it takes 2 steps  
For `n = 3`, it takes 3 steps  
For `n = 4`, it takes 5 steps  
and so on  

Now normally you would do this using a while loop and finding the nth
fibonacci using $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$.  

But I decided to do it differently and stumbled upon [Binet's Formula and The Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) and the formula is given as such:

**Implementation in Rust**

```rs
fn climb_stairs(mut n: i32) -> i32 {
    n = n + 1;

    let sqrt_five = (5 as f64).sqrt();
    let phi = (1.0 + sqrt_five) / 2.0;
    
    let f_n = (f64::powf(phi, n.into()) - f64::powf(1.0 - phi, n.into())) / sqrt_five;

    f_n as i32
}
```

Time Complexity: $O(1)$
