## Problem statement

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

**Example 1**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

## Solutions

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

There is perhaps no problem worse than this one *(inb4 it keeps getting worse from here on).*  
I've spent about a day pondering about it and couldn't find a solution, I had to go look at
LeetCode solutions, only to realize that I still didn't understand anything at all.  

Surprisingly, a [GeeksForGeeks video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns4LCeeOFS4)[^1] helped me understand how to solve
this god forsaken problem.

The idea behind it is quite simple, you initialize an array dp of size N with 1 and iteratively check
whether the previous number is smaller, if it is, then you increment dp AND also check if current
dp is less than previous dp + 1.

**Pseudocode**

```text
initialize array dp of size N with 1s
max = 0

begin ith loop from 1 to N - 1
    begin jth loop from 0 to i - 1
        if dp[i] > dp[j] AND dp[i] < dp[j] + 1
            dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
    
    get max of max and dp[i]

return max
```

**Implementation in Rust**

```rs
fn length_of_lis(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut max_count: i32 = 0;
    let mut dp = vec![1; nums.len()];
    if nums.len() == 1 {
        return 1;
    }
    for i in 1..nums.len() {
        for j in 0..i {
            if nums[i] > nums[j] && dp[i] < dp[j] + 1{
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
            }
        }
        max_count = std::cmp::max(dp[i], max_count);
    }
    max_count
}
```

Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$  
Space Complexity: $O(n)$  
Runtime on LeetCode: $99$ms, wow.
