## Problem statement

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

## Solutions

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming - Bottom Up

This was easier to come up with than the last problem, we essentially tabulate
two strings and check for the occurences. The following picture may describe it
far better than anything

![LeetCode Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/votrubac/image_1564691262.png)  

What happens is:

1. Do the two characters in the table match? then that cell will be 1 + whatever the previous row and column had.
2. If they do not match, take the max of left cell or the cell above, because there is a possibility that there could be
continuation of the subsequence.


**Pseudocode**

```text
initialize 2d array dp of size N+1 x M+1 

begin ith loop from 1 to N + 1
    begin jth loop from 1 to M + 1
        if characters match
            dp[i][j] = max of current cell or 1 + previous diagonal cell
        else 
            dp[i][j] = max of previous row or column
    
return dp[N][M]
```

**Implementation in Rust**

```rs
fn longest_common_subsequence(text1: String, text2: String) -> i32 {
    let mut dp = vec![vec![0; text2.len() + 1]; text1.len() + 1];
    for i in 1..text1.len() + 1 {
        for j in 1..text2.len() + 1 {
            if text1.chars().nth(i - 1) == text2.chars().nth(j - 1) {
                dp[i][j] = std::cmp::max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = std::cmp::max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    dp[text1.len()][text2.len()]
}
```

Time Complexity: $O(nm)$  
Space Complexity: $O(nm)$  
Runtime on LeetCode: $1179$ms, that doesn't feel optimal.

> Neetcode mentioned a similar approach but his started at the end and finished at (0,0)
> Similar implementation but just reverse the loops.
